# **A) What is n8n? (Replace Zapier/Make with n8n)**

Hi everyone, and welcome to our n8n Master Course. It's your Lead Gen Man here, and if you haven't heard about n8n, you might be living under a rock. n8n.io is a digital automation platform that allows you to build, test and deploy AI and automation with minimal or zero coding at all. It is a drag and drop AI agent builder that allows you to build AI agents within minutes and hours, and not weeks and months. n8n has become the hottest thing under the sun right now. And to prove my point, let us go to Google search and let us search for worldwide from past 12 months. So let us add our search term of n8n, and let us compare with Make.com and Zapier. And if you haven't heard about Make.com or Zapier, they are similar tools like n8n, but n8n is much more cheaper and scalable. Let us compare that with Zapier and Make.com. You can see the blue line, which indicates n8n, and the growth of n8n is exponential, like Zapier, and Make.com has been in this field for more than 12 years now and everyone knows that. But nowadays everyone is switching to n8n due to its scalability and due to its effectiveness. So why wait? And let's start building powerful agents by using n8n. So head over to n8n.io and sign up or login with your account. Yeah, it is free for the first 15 days as well as it is free forever if you are running n8n on your local computer (self-host). Don't worry about this thing, just get started with n8n and then we will switch into much more complex things.

But don't be like Jack. Jack is a person who goes to YouTube, search for all the crazy n8n automation and workflows and just mindlessly export it into his account. And one day his boss asked him to make some changes or make some alternative and configuration into their existing workflows. And at that point, Jack wasn't able to do anything. Even after exporting more than 100+ n8n automation and workflows, he was not able to make even small changes for his company's workflow. So don't be like Jack. And this reminds me of this phrase Jack of all trades, master of none. The summary of our Jack story is: it does not matter how big or how many workflows that you have imported. It only matters that this automation and workflows solve your business queries and problems. That's it.

And in order to build your customized and personalized workflows, you first of all need to understand the fundamental blocks or the building blocks of n8n. Otherwise, you will be like Jack who just goes to YouTube, imports all these workflows and will not be able to configure a little bit. Because all businesses have different difficulties and challenges they are trying to solve. And there is no one size fit for all automation or workflows. And that's why you need to understand the fundamentals first. Otherwise, you are going to have a hard time building automation and workflows inside n8n. And that's why I am here. In this lecture, I'm going to break down the entire building blocks of n8n. And then after you have gained this knowledge, you can build literally any automation that you have in your mind for your business.

But first of all, we need to understand why we are using n8n. Obviously, we need to automate our business queries or our personal life. So we need to understand what is automation. We have understood what is n8n, right? n8n is a digital automation platform that allows you to build, test and deploy AI agents and AI automation with minimal or no coding. Now let us understand what is automation. I have gone to Google and searched for the dictionary definition of automation. Automation is a predictable set of predetermined actions that transfer one data to another data point. I know my handwriting is not good, but you have to bear with me. Let's first of all understand the automation definition. So a set of predetermined actions: predetermined actions basically means that if our automation or workflow will execute, then this thing will obviously happen. That's why we have the definition of predictable set of predetermined actions that transfer data from one point to another.

So let us take an example to visualize this much better. Let's say we have an online form. We are collecting the company name and company information, what kind of company they have or they are in. Now let's say if the form does not have any company name in it, no company name, we will just simply ignore that form. If that company is of low value, we will add that company to our email sequence. Next, if that company is high value, we will add that to our Google Sheets. And if that company is in our ICP or ideal customer profile, we want to get instantly notified inside our Slack — send message to our Slack. And this is an example of automation. Here we have predetermined action. For instance, if that company is of low value, it will go to the email step. If that company is in our ICP, we will send that company to our Slack message. We know what will happen as per our criteria and condition that we have assigned inside our automation.

So we have covered this point till here. Now the next thing in automation is we are moving data from one particle or one element, or we are moving one atom to another atom in another space. So we have our first data here. We are sending them to what kind of company they have. And after assigning the criteria, we are sending our data to whatever module or whatever app that we are going to use inside our automation. So again, to summarize, automation is replacing manual or repeat tasks by using software or tools, either partially or fully. For instance, if you are not using automation here, right, we have to sort of have a human here that will decide if this company is all right, if this company is high value, low value, or ICP. But by using automation, we are replacing this manual task, increasing our efficiency, saving time plus money.

All right. Now I hope you understand why we use automation. And for building automation we need to do some sort of help platform like n8n. So let us explore n8n core components or building blocks. The first core component inside n8n is trigger. If you are building any automation, trigger component will be your starting point in any automation that you are going to build inside n8n. So let us understand this with a racing gun analogy. As you might notice, in any running race, there will be a gun and when that gun fires off, everyone will start running. This is what exactly trigger does inside n8n. Whenever the trigger module starts, it will execute our entire automation or workflow inside n8n. And again, scenario/workflow/automation — they all have similar terminology inside n8n. Again, trigger model will initiate or launch your workflows inside n8n. And that's why it is the most important core component of n8n.

So we have basically three types of triggers. First is you can either start your automation manually as well as you can schedule your automation. For instance, if you want to run your automation, let's say every one minute, every one hour, or at specific time, at specific day or at specific month, you can schedule your automation as that. So let us take example, let's say every one minute, every one hour, every Friday at 5 p.m. — whenever you want to schedule, you can schedule automation. Lastly, we have automatic or instant. For instance, let's take our example of form. So whenever someone will submit a form, it will automatically execute this automation and it will automatically judge what kind of company they have. So here there is no scheduling concept. It will not check every single hour or every single minute. It will only execute when it will receive external data. Yeah. So that's the beauty of Instant Trigger.

So let us take example of form submission. Another example could be once a new row has been added to your Google Sheet or Airtable, it will execute your workflow. Whatever you want to have for trigger, you can use that and it will execute it instantly. Google Sheet property update or row update. We can also have webhooks. We will talk about webhooks later on. Don't worry if you don't know what is webhook. All right. To again summarize, there are three types of triggers. You can run your automation manually, you can schedule your automation and you can instantly execute your automation. The benefit of instant triggers is for example, let us take this comparison, right? It will check every single hour and it will execute instantly. So if you are dealing with sensitive data and if you want to update your Google Sheet or whatever data, you will definitely need to use instant triggers because you are playing with sensitive data and you don't want to wait for one hour. That's why we use instant triggers.

Now let us talk about the second core fundamental or second block of n8n component. So we have filters or filtering. And it will have a shape like this. So this is a funnel. Filter, as the name suggests, will either allow or block certain types of data from flowing through the next module. It will allow or block certain types of data from flowing to the next path. That's all you need to know about filtering. And trust me, we're going to use filters a lot inside our automation.

Now the next thing or next core component we need to cover is Apps. So App can be whatever you have in your mind — it can be Notion, it can be Google Drive, it can be Slack, etc., etc. Now just simply selecting the app is not enough. For instance, you need to give some sort of action or function that the app needs to execute. That's why we have the action component. So the fourth component is action component. So basically it will be inside apps. Let's take example of Google Sheet app. There are so many actions or so many functions we can do. For instance, we can delete a row. We can update a row. We can add a row. We can delete a cell, etc., etc. So just simply selecting an app is not enough. We need to define certain functions or actions we need to achieve from the apps. That's why actions are so important.

Let's say we want to update a page. I'm talking about Notion app right from here. We need to delete a page. We need to delete a user. So we need to define what actions that we need to do inside our automation. For Google Drive we need to create a folder. We need to delete a file. We need to create a share link. Similarly, in Slack we need to send a message. We need to send message to the community. We need to get the update. We need to find or we need to search, etc. etc.

To understand actions even better, let us go to 30,000 ft height or the top of Mount Everest and let us see down the automation or workflows. Basically, every automation will follow this path inside n8n automation. The first component obviously will be the trigger, right? Without trigger, your automation won't execute or won't launch. That's why trigger component will be a starting point in any automation that you are going to build in n8n. So we are going to have the first module of triggers. You can set it up either instantly, you can set it up either manually or scheduling. Let us use the scheduling one. Right. So let us change the color. We want to execute this automation every day at 9:00 a.m. Then what we are doing with this automation is we are either moving data from one place to another. We are either changing or manipulating data. For instance, we want to sort our data or we want to use filters or filtering, segmenting, formatting, etc. Basically, we are manipulating the data that we will get from triggers into whatever we want to use. And then what we are going to do is we are going to send it to Apps or basically actions, what actions we want to perform inside our automation. This will be actions and to quickly summarize actions. It can be GET. It can be SEND. It can be UPDATE. It can be DELETE. Yep. So 90% of the time we are going to use these actions like get, send, update or delete.

And that's the bird's eye view of n8n workflow. First, we will have trigger. Then we are manipulating data or changing data. And then we are performing actions that we want to execute from our apps. Yeah, that's pretty much it. That's all you need to know. Congratulations, guys. You now know the fundamental or building block of n8n even much better than AI gurus that you see in YouTube. But one thing I want to emphasize is before you start building your automation, you will need to have some sort of flow or wireframe in your mind before you get started. I will suggest that the best practices here are having proper knowledge of apps and actions that you need inside your automation. So I will suggest to do mappings. Let's change the color to blue. Mappings basically means this will be step one. This will be step two. This will be step three. This will be step four, and so on. So once you're inside n8n, you won't have to figure out what you need to do next. And you won't be staring at the blank canvas. You will have some sort of idea what you want, and you can easily start building automation inside n8n.

That's all from my side. And in the next lecture, we are going to cover some more additional context and some more additional information that you need to know before building automation inside n8n. That's all from my side and I will see you in the next one.

# **B) Understanding APIs and Webhooks**

Hi everyone. Welcome back to our foundation of N8N lectures. Now it's time to discuss what APIs and webhooks are inside N810 and why they are the fundamental building blocks inside our workflows. Again, we are going to go back to our whiteboard and I will break down everything. This time, I will do it side by side with the N810 platform and its interface so that you get familiarized with what I am talking about and nothing goes out of your head. Alright, so let us get started.

As you can remember from the last lecture, we talked about the core components, which I am repeating again: triggers, filtering apps, and actions. Therefore, it's time to understand how these apps interact and talk with each other, basically passing data from one point to another without you having to write a single line of code. Yes, these concepts are from computer science and data structures, but you still need to fundamentally understand how data flows from one module to another, or one app to another.

First of all, let us understand what an API is. If we look into the dictionary, an API is defined as an application programming interface. Most people will not easily understand what an API is just by this definition, so we need to break it down into a real-world analogy. Imagine you go to a restaurant and sit at a table. A waiter will come, you will give your order, the waiter will go to the kitchen and pass your order to the chef. The chef prepares the food, hands it back to the waiter, and the waiter serves it to you at your table. That's how an API works. Let us put this on your whiteboard so it is easy to understand. The waiter acts as an API. You are the client here, and you want to request data or information from the server or application, which could be Google Sheets, Google Docs, etc. When you send a request for data, the API communicates with the server or application, retrieves the response, and sends it back to you. The main reason we use APIs is that we do not know in which language the server or application is coded—it could be Python, C++, Java, etc. If you don't know the programming language, you cannot directly ask the server for data. The API acts as a communicator or translator, so you do not have to provide any code; it handles the communication and retrieves the response for you.

Let us take another example to understand better. Imagine you are using Slack and want to send a message to your community or DM someone. Slack could be coded in any programming language, and you do not know how to communicate with that language directly. That's why we use an API. You send a request to the API to post your message, the API communicates with Slack, Slack processes the request, and returns a 200 response, indicating the message was sent successfully. It's as easy as that. Again, it is nothing rocket science—you just need to fundamentally understand why we use APIs. You do not have to create APIs yourself; we use existing APIs. But having context and knowledge is essential to create automation without fear when interacting with back-end systems.

Now, it is important to understand that requests have types and responses also vary. Whenever you send a request, there could be multiple types of requests, such as sending, retrieving, or deleting a message. There are four primary building blocks of a request: URL, method, headers, and body. Body is optional, and requests are sent in HTTP format, which is why we refer to them as HTTP requests. Let us break these down in detail and in layman’s terms.

First, URLs. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is a unique location for a resource on the web. Every page or image has a URL, which is its address. Next are methods, which indicate what action we want to perform on that URL. The most common methods we use are GET and POST. GET retrieves or receives data, such as extracting the first five rows from a Google Sheet. POST sends data to a server or application, like sending a Slack message or creating a Trello card. There are other methods such as DELETE, PUT, and PATCH, but we rarely use them.

Headers provide more context or information to the request. For example, they specify the response format (like JSON), the language of the response (Python, JavaScript, etc.), or the device type. Headers help the server understand the type of information you want to receive. Lastly, the body is optional and is only used in POST requests. It contains the information you want to send to the server, such as first name, last name, and email from a form submission. If you do not include a body, the server may return all available data, making it harder to extract what you need. By specifying data in the body, the response only includes relevant information.

There are also secondary components of a request, such as authentication or credentials. These confirm that you have proper access to the server or application, ensuring that the request is legitimate and secure. Authentication can be an API key or OAuth, like when logging into a Google account.

Now that we have covered the request, let us look at the response. A response consists of a status code, headers, and a body. Status codes are three-digit numbers indicating whether your request was successful or encountered an error. Common status codes include 200 (success), 401 (unauthorized), 404 (not found), and 500 (internal server error). For example, a 200 code indicates that your request was successful, while 404 indicates that the requested resource is not available, and 500 indicates a server-side issue. Headers in the response provide additional context, such as content type or content length, while the body contains the actual data returned by the server in HTML, JSON, or other formats. Understanding these components ensures you can make API calls confidently and interpret responses correctly.

Finally, let us talk about webhooks. A webhook is like a notification system. Imagine your house has a mailbox or a doorbell. There are two types of webhooks: polling (or scheduled) and instant. In polling, you check the door every 15 minutes to see if someone is there. In an instant webhook, the bell rings as soon as someone arrives. The advantage of instant webhooks is that you do not need to check repeatedly; data is sent or received automatically in real-time.

In conclusion, we have covered APIs and webhooks thoroughly. You now understand how to make requests and receive responses from a server, the main components of requests and responses, and the types and advantages of webhooks. This foundational knowledge will allow you to create automation and AI agents confidently using the N810 platform. In the next lecture, we will look at hands-on practical exercises inside the interface to get more familiar with using APIs and webhooks.

# **C) Nodes: The Building Blocks of n8n**

Hi everyone, it’s Legion Man here, and in this lecture we are going to look into the interface or platform of n8n. It’s time to say goodbye to our handy-dandy iPad. I think we’ve already covered the foundation or building blocks of n8n, and now it’s time to deep dive into the platform or interface so that you guys can get more familiarized with it.

Before we begin, let me know which teaching style you prefer. For instance, I can easily pull up a PowerPoint and teach you everything, but I’ve seen that using a whiteboard and a pen—like our school teachers did with a blackboard and chalk—helps us understand concepts much better. It feels more natural and engaging. So, let me know what you think: should I continue with this whiteboard or pencil technique, or should I move on to the PowerPoint approach? Do share your thoughts in the community—I’m always looking to improve.

In this lecture, let’s start by understanding nodes. Nodes are basically the atoms or building blocks of n8n. You cannot build any automation without using nodes. There are mainly three types of nodes: Entry (Trigger), Function (App/Action), and Exit Point. The entry node triggers the workflow, the function node performs an action such as interacting with apps like Google Sheets or Slack, and the exit point represents the end or final output of your automation.

There are many types of nodes in n8n, including triggers, actions, data manipulation or transformation nodes, flows, files, and more. But now, let’s move to our end-to-end workflow and see all of this in action. Make sure you’re logged in or signed up with your account, and click on the Create Flow button to get started and build your first workflow inside n8n.

Congratulations, you’re now on the canvas of n8n. You’ll see a “+” button, which is used to add your first trigger. Let’s get familiar with the n8n interface first. Here, you can easily save and share your automations. The editor section is where you can add nodes and actions. Once you execute your automation, you’ll be able to see the results of your workflow in the Execution tab. Don’t worry too much about that for now. You can rename your workflow (for example, “First Workflow” or “Test Workflow”), apply tags, and organize them into projects to keep everything structured within your organization.

If you’re building complex automations with many nodes, n8n offers a feature to automatically organize them—just click on the structure button, and it will neatly align all the nodes in your editor.

Let’s now add our first module or node, which will be the Trigger. Click on the “+” icon and choose a trigger. A trigger is always the starting point of your automation. There are three types of triggers: Manual, Schedule, and Webhook. Manual means you start the automation by clicking on it; Schedule means it runs at specific times; and Webhook means it starts automatically when an external event calls it. For now, let’s choose to trigger the automation manually.

Remember, a trigger node always has an output branch but never an input branch—that’s one way to identify it. To open any node, just double-click on it. You can rename it (for example, “Test Trigger”), and you’ll see settings and parameters related to that node. You can delete nodes, activate or deactivate them, or even execute a single node without running the whole workflow.

Every workflow in n8n starts with a trigger, so it’s mandatory to have one. You can easily recognize them by their Thunderbolt icon. Now, let’s talk about useful nodes. There are many, such as triggers, actions (apps), and data transformation nodes.

Let’s look at actions and apps. For example, if you search for Google Sheets, you’ll find various actions like “Create Spreadsheet,” “Delete Spreadsheet,” “Get Rows,” or “Update Rows.” You can also use triggers like “On Row Updated.” So, if you don’t want to start your automation manually, you can trigger it whenever a row is updated in Google Sheets. Similarly, you can integrate with apps like Notion, Slack, or Typeform, depending on your use case.

Now, let’s explore data transformation nodes. One of the most important nodes you’ll frequently use is Edit Fields (or “Set”). This node is extremely useful for optimizing workflows. For example, suppose you’re receiving “First Name” and “Last Name” from Google Sheets, but your Google Form expects a single “Full Name” field. You can use Edit Fields to merge the two and send it as one.

You can also use it to filter and reduce data. For example, if you’re fetching ten rows from Google Sheets but only need the first name, you can use Edit Fields to extract only that column. This prevents unnecessary data from passing through every node and keeps your workflow efficient.

Other data transformation nodes include Aggregate (to combine multiple items into a list), Remove Duplicates, Summarize, Split Out, and Limit. These help in structuring and processing your data efficiently.

Now, about Webhooks—we covered this in an earlier lecture, but to recap, webhooks allow your workflow to listen to external events. When you create a webhook node, it provides a unique URL that listens for incoming data. You can test it by clicking “Listen for Test Event”, then sending a request to that URL. Once triggered, your workflow starts automatically.

You can also use Edit Fields with webhooks. For instance, after connecting an Edit Fields node to a webhook, you can filter or rename the incoming data. You can use fixed values (hardcoded) or expressions (dynamic variables). After testing, you’ll see only the data you need, keeping your workflow clean and focused.

Aggregator nodes, as the name suggests, combine fields from multiple items into a single list. While n8n has over 200 different nodes, you don’t need to memorize all of them—focus on understanding how they work conceptually.

That’s all for this lecture. Get familiar with the n8n interface; it’s not too complex. Don’t feel overwhelmed or intimidated—if I can do it, you can do it too. Take care, and I’ll see you in the next one.
