# **A) What is n8n? (Replace Zapier/Make with n8n)**

Hi everyone, and welcome to our n8n Master Course. It's your Lead Gen Man here, and if you haven't heard about n8n, you might be living under a rock. n8n.io is a digital automation platform that allows you to build, test and deploy AI and automation with minimal or zero coding at all. It is a drag and drop AI agent builder that allows you to build AI agents within minutes and hours, and not weeks and months. n8n has become the hottest thing under the sun right now. And to prove my point, let us go to Google search and let us search for worldwide from past 12 months. So let us add our search term of n8n, and let us compare with Make.com and Zapier. And if you haven't heard about Make.com or Zapier, they are similar tools like n8n, but n8n is much more cheaper and scalable. Let us compare that with Zapier and Make.com. You can see the blue line, which indicates n8n, and the growth of n8n is exponential, like Zapier, and Make.com has been in this field for more than 12 years now and everyone knows that. But nowadays everyone is switching to n8n due to its scalability and due to its effectiveness. So why wait? And let's start building powerful agents by using n8n. So head over to n8n.io and sign up or login with your account. Yeah, it is free for the first 15 days as well as it is free forever if you are running n8n on your local computer (self-host). Don't worry about this thing, just get started with n8n and then we will switch into much more complex things.

But don't be like Jack. Jack is a person who goes to YouTube, search for all the crazy n8n automation and workflows and just mindlessly export it into his account. And one day his boss asked him to make some changes or make some alternative and configuration into their existing workflows. And at that point, Jack wasn't able to do anything. Even after exporting more than 100+ n8n automation and workflows, he was not able to make even small changes for his company's workflow. So don't be like Jack. And this reminds me of this phrase Jack of all trades, master of none. The summary of our Jack story is: it does not matter how big or how many workflows that you have imported. It only matters that this automation and workflows solve your business queries and problems. That's it.

And in order to build your customized and personalized workflows, you first of all need to understand the fundamental blocks or the building blocks of n8n. Otherwise, you will be like Jack who just goes to YouTube, imports all these workflows and will not be able to configure a little bit. Because all businesses have different difficulties and challenges they are trying to solve. And there is no one size fit for all automation or workflows. And that's why you need to understand the fundamentals first. Otherwise, you are going to have a hard time building automation and workflows inside n8n. And that's why I am here. In this lecture, I'm going to break down the entire building blocks of n8n. And then after you have gained this knowledge, you can build literally any automation that you have in your mind for your business.

But first of all, we need to understand why we are using n8n. Obviously, we need to automate our business queries or our personal life. So we need to understand what is automation. We have understood what is n8n, right? n8n is a digital automation platform that allows you to build, test and deploy AI agents and AI automation with minimal or no coding. Now let us understand what is automation. I have gone to Google and searched for the dictionary definition of automation. Automation is a predictable set of predetermined actions that transfer one data to another data point. I know my handwriting is not good, but you have to bear with me. Let's first of all understand the automation definition. So a set of predetermined actions: predetermined actions basically means that if our automation or workflow will execute, then this thing will obviously happen. That's why we have the definition of predictable set of predetermined actions that transfer data from one point to another.

So let us take an example to visualize this much better. Let's say we have an online form. We are collecting the company name and company information, what kind of company they have or they are in. Now let's say if the form does not have any company name in it, no company name, we will just simply ignore that form. If that company is of low value, we will add that company to our email sequence. Next, if that company is high value, we will add that to our Google Sheets. And if that company is in our ICP or ideal customer profile, we want to get instantly notified inside our Slack — send message to our Slack. And this is an example of automation. Here we have predetermined action. For instance, if that company is of low value, it will go to the email step. If that company is in our ICP, we will send that company to our Slack message. We know what will happen as per our criteria and condition that we have assigned inside our automation.

So we have covered this point till here. Now the next thing in automation is we are moving data from one particle or one element, or we are moving one atom to another atom in another space. So we have our first data here. We are sending them to what kind of company they have. And after assigning the criteria, we are sending our data to whatever module or whatever app that we are going to use inside our automation. So again, to summarize, automation is replacing manual or repeat tasks by using software or tools, either partially or fully. For instance, if you are not using automation here, right, we have to sort of have a human here that will decide if this company is all right, if this company is high value, low value, or ICP. But by using automation, we are replacing this manual task, increasing our efficiency, saving time plus money.

All right. Now I hope you understand why we use automation. And for building automation we need to do some sort of help platform like n8n. So let us explore n8n core components or building blocks. The first core component inside n8n is trigger. If you are building any automation, trigger component will be your starting point in any automation that you are going to build inside n8n. So let us understand this with a racing gun analogy. As you might notice, in any running race, there will be a gun and when that gun fires off, everyone will start running. This is what exactly trigger does inside n8n. Whenever the trigger module starts, it will execute our entire automation or workflow inside n8n. And again, scenario/workflow/automation — they all have similar terminology inside n8n. Again, trigger model will initiate or launch your workflows inside n8n. And that's why it is the most important core component of n8n.

So we have basically three types of triggers. First is you can either start your automation manually as well as you can schedule your automation. For instance, if you want to run your automation, let's say every one minute, every one hour, or at specific time, at specific day or at specific month, you can schedule your automation as that. So let us take example, let's say every one minute, every one hour, every Friday at 5 p.m. — whenever you want to schedule, you can schedule automation. Lastly, we have automatic or instant. For instance, let's take our example of form. So whenever someone will submit a form, it will automatically execute this automation and it will automatically judge what kind of company they have. So here there is no scheduling concept. It will not check every single hour or every single minute. It will only execute when it will receive external data. Yeah. So that's the beauty of Instant Trigger.

So let us take example of form submission. Another example could be once a new row has been added to your Google Sheet or Airtable, it will execute your workflow. Whatever you want to have for trigger, you can use that and it will execute it instantly. Google Sheet property update or row update. We can also have webhooks. We will talk about webhooks later on. Don't worry if you don't know what is webhook. All right. To again summarize, there are three types of triggers. You can run your automation manually, you can schedule your automation and you can instantly execute your automation. The benefit of instant triggers is for example, let us take this comparison, right? It will check every single hour and it will execute instantly. So if you are dealing with sensitive data and if you want to update your Google Sheet or whatever data, you will definitely need to use instant triggers because you are playing with sensitive data and you don't want to wait for one hour. That's why we use instant triggers.

Now let us talk about the second core fundamental or second block of n8n component. So we have filters or filtering. And it will have a shape like this. So this is a funnel. Filter, as the name suggests, will either allow or block certain types of data from flowing through the next module. It will allow or block certain types of data from flowing to the next path. That's all you need to know about filtering. And trust me, we're going to use filters a lot inside our automation.

Now the next thing or next core component we need to cover is Apps. So App can be whatever you have in your mind — it can be Notion, it can be Google Drive, it can be Slack, etc., etc. Now just simply selecting the app is not enough. For instance, you need to give some sort of action or function that the app needs to execute. That's why we have the action component. So the fourth component is action component. So basically it will be inside apps. Let's take example of Google Sheet app. There are so many actions or so many functions we can do. For instance, we can delete a row. We can update a row. We can add a row. We can delete a cell, etc., etc. So just simply selecting an app is not enough. We need to define certain functions or actions we need to achieve from the apps. That's why actions are so important.

Let's say we want to update a page. I'm talking about Notion app right from here. We need to delete a page. We need to delete a user. So we need to define what actions that we need to do inside our automation. For Google Drive we need to create a folder. We need to delete a file. We need to create a share link. Similarly, in Slack we need to send a message. We need to send message to the community. We need to get the update. We need to find or we need to search, etc. etc.

To understand actions even better, let us go to 30,000 ft height or the top of Mount Everest and let us see down the automation or workflows. Basically, every automation will follow this path inside n8n automation. The first component obviously will be the trigger, right? Without trigger, your automation won't execute or won't launch. That's why trigger component will be a starting point in any automation that you are going to build in n8n. So we are going to have the first module of triggers. You can set it up either instantly, you can set it up either manually or scheduling. Let us use the scheduling one. Right. So let us change the color. We want to execute this automation every day at 9:00 a.m. Then what we are doing with this automation is we are either moving data from one place to another. We are either changing or manipulating data. For instance, we want to sort our data or we want to use filters or filtering, segmenting, formatting, etc. Basically, we are manipulating the data that we will get from triggers into whatever we want to use. And then what we are going to do is we are going to send it to Apps or basically actions, what actions we want to perform inside our automation. This will be actions and to quickly summarize actions. It can be GET. It can be SEND. It can be UPDATE. It can be DELETE. Yep. So 90% of the time we are going to use these actions like get, send, update or delete.

And that's the bird's eye view of n8n workflow. First, we will have trigger. Then we are manipulating data or changing data. And then we are performing actions that we want to execute from our apps. Yeah, that's pretty much it. That's all you need to know. Congratulations, guys. You now know the fundamental or building block of n8n even much better than AI gurus that you see in YouTube. But one thing I want to emphasize is before you start building your automation, you will need to have some sort of flow or wireframe in your mind before you get started. I will suggest that the best practices here are having proper knowledge of apps and actions that you need inside your automation. So I will suggest to do mappings. Let's change the color to blue. Mappings basically means this will be step one. This will be step two. This will be step three. This will be step four, and so on. So once you're inside n8n, you won't have to figure out what you need to do next. And you won't be staring at the blank canvas. You will have some sort of idea what you want, and you can easily start building automation inside n8n.

That's all from my side. And in the next lecture, we are going to cover some more additional context and some more additional information that you need to know before building automation inside n8n. That's all from my side and I will see you in the next one.
